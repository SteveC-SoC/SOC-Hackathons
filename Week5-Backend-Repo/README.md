# Backend Repo

Week five Hackathon from SOC, The idea was to have a database of definitions for writing code with examples. frontend and backend are set up, however there is an error connecting to the database that will need to be corrected. Putting the connection credentials into UserSecrets was very satisfying (not to mention important).

Working with Tibz

## Language used
C#  
HTML  
JavaScript  
CSS


## New things learnt
Interfaces  
CORS  
UserSecrets

## To run
Fronend can be opened in a browser after you have cloned the code, there is not much to see on this one, as cannot connect to database

## Further goals  
connect to database  
re-do frontend to be more interactive
