Unity game

Week eight saw us introduced to the Unity game engin. We were given three days to get our heads round how the engine worked, how to use it and create a game. We made a Mario/platformer type of 2D game. On this project I focused on the Unity game engine over the coding, I was responsible for the level design/creation.

No code to show on this one as it links with the Unity game engine and I need to go through this at a later date, Also any future projects should be hosted for easy access.

Working with Rob and Stella

## Language used
C#

## New things learnt
intro to the Unity game engine

## Further goals  
Work on future projects using the Unity Game engine, this would be a good way to practice/learn more C#. There is a abundance of resources for this and it would be good fun to create some games using this engine.
