# Joke viewer

Week seven Hackathon from SOC, This one got away from us. Our inital idea was to have the user flip a coin (animated and shown on the browser), if they won, they would get a point. If they lost they would loose a point and get a random Dad joke (from an API). We spent a lot of time workin on the coin, and in the end parked this to have the Dad joke from Homer and a response given by Bart (random from a list of 4 response)

Working with Jenn, Mafe, Ellie
