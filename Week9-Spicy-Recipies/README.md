# Spicy Recipies
Unity game

Week nine and we are back on React and C# backend. This weeks hackathon was a full stack applicaiton built in one day. As part of a team of five, we decided to have a laugh and have the app call daft recipies from our database and display this on the front end when called.

Working with Ellie, Stella, Sereena, Char

## Language used
C#  
JSX  
JavaScript

## New things learnt
Refresher on the backend, creating respoitories, controllers, database and connecting the frontend to the backend

## Further goals  
There is an error when app is first opened up that needs looking into. This only errors on mount, so thinkin it may be because there is no information to show at the start  

Connection credentails need to be added to User Secrets (I've forgot how this is done and will need to look up)  
background picture is not showing, This was on Slack, this should have been stored in the app file to avoid this.
