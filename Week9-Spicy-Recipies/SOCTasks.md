# Snap Back to Reactathon, Keep it Fullstackathon!!

## The challenge

A full stack app in **ONE DAY** that has the following:

- Front end in React
- Server in ASP.NET
- Database in Postgres
- Jest tests on the front end
- XUnit tests on the back end

Ideate, break it down, plan and execute! (And keep in mind the agile principles...)

Happy Hacking!! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Back end:

Main features/ideas:

- create a joint account of Heroku
- Think about what information our database will have
- create a table using postgres and populate it
- run a new api
- storing users notes in our database as well

Files:

- Base repository (connecting to our heroku database, storing our environmental variables on the terminal)
- IRepository (the contract)
- Recipe Controller (takes in HTTP request, Get, GetAll, Post/Insert, Delete, Update)
- Recipe Class (properties: ID, Ingredient/s, Method, author, time taken)
- SQL table (here we create a table which contains the properties: ID, Ingredient/s, Method, author, time taken)
- Recipe Repository (connecting to our database and controller)
- Write simple test (test Get?)

Front end:

- Create react app

Components

- App (Front Page, linked to the comps )
- Button (generate a random recipe)
- List (store our recipes, useEffect?)
- Write a simple jest test

Front End deeper...
