## SOC-Hackathons

#Goal  
upload the Hackathons from my time in SOC, these were weekly challenges. I will go through these (as they are currently private) remove any unused code, refresh myself on these, add comments to explain the code (if not currently present).  
Each Hackathon will have its own folder, which will contain a README explaining the Hackathon.
