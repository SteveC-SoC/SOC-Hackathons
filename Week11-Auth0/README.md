# Blobathon  

Learnt about Auth0, a plugin package used to authorise the user, this was easy to follow using the walk through and really rewarding to see in action. This app was not completed due to a CORS error on the backend which we spent most of the day trying to fix.

## New things learnt
I really like the Auth0 it was easy to use, which surprised me. i thought it would be more complicated to do, but I guess when using this pre-built authorisation, the heavey lifting has been done for you. 

## Further goals  
I would like to use Auth0 more, see what other options it can be used for and to have the login reflect the user (for example, here is your personalised page or "this" is where you got to)  

CORS error needs fixing and then an app could be built on the front end.
