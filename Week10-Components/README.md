# Blobathon  

The blob (nickname for Cohort 5) all made a individual component that was then published as a library. Then build an app using these components

Make an app that uses the [blob component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blob-components).  

Working with Pulkit

## Language used
JSX  
JavaScript

## New things learnt
The importance of making a component self sufficient to allow this to be used later or in other apps

## Further goals  
The app is pretty basic, not much to see with it. I have no future goals with this app, it was a lerning exercise on the importance of self sufficient components
