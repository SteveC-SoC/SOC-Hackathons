# To-do List  

Week four Hackathon from SOC, Building a to-do list, with a front and backend

The backend connects to the database (hosted on Heroku) and stores the to-do tasks. The frontend takes in an input, it sends, retrives and deletes items from the database, and the items can be sorted into order.

Working with Stella

## Language used
C#
HTML
JavaScript

## New things learnt

## to run
clone down the code for the back and frontend, run the backend with a dotnet run in the console, for the frontend, just open it in your browser (local host).

## further goals  
The delete all is not working
The database credentials are visable (big no no, I need to put these into secrets)
