## Final Project  


In a team of 5, we were given 2 weeks to create a full stack web app from scratch. Using React, we made a well structured front-end that used a Leaflet interactive map, displayed information fetched from APIs, and deployed on Netlify. Our ASP.NET back-end, connected with our Heroku database, to pull information from our Web Scraping bot.
