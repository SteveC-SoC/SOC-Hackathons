## Final Project  


In a team of 5, we were given 2 weeks to create a full stack web app from scratch. Using React, we made a well structured front-end that used a Leaflet interactive map, displayed information fetched from APIs, and deployed on Netlify. Our ASP.NET back-end, connected with our Heroku database, to pull information from our Web Scraping bot.  

This was the result of what we have learnt over the bootcamp along with some additional bits (lazy loading, how to refresh on the browser without breaking the app).  

I am really proud of the app we built, it stuck to our initial goal of being informative, clean layout, accurate and upto date information.

## Issues
The app still takes longer than I would like to load. This would be greatly reduced by lazy loading each individual page, however When we did this the CSS was affected, as a team we agreed that it would be better to present the app looking clean, with a delay in loading, over quick load, but not looking the way we wanted it to.
